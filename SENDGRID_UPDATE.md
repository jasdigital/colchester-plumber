# SendGrid Integration Update

## Changes Made

The email functionality has been updated to use SendGrid's Web API directly instead of nodemailer, following Vercel best practices with comprehensive try-catch error handling.

### Key Improvements

1. **Vercel-Optimized**: Uses SendGrid Web API directly via fetch, which is better suited for serverless environments
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with specific error responses
3. **Better Performance**: No additional dependencies required, uses native fetch
4. **Improved Security**: Proper environment variable validation

### Technical Changes

#### Before (nodemailer approach):
- Used nodemailer with SendGrid SMTP
- Required additional dependencies
- Less suitable for serverless environments

#### After (SendGrid Web API):
- Direct API calls to SendGrid
- Zero additional dependencies
- Optimized for Vercel/serverless deployment
- Better error handling and user feedback

### Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set in your Vercel deployment:

```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your_actual_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@colchester-plumber.co.uk
BUSINESS_EMAIL=bookings@colchester-plumber.co.uk
```

### API Response Structure

The API now returns more specific error messages:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Quote request submitted successfully"
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- `400`: Invalid request data (missing fields)
- `500`: Server configuration error
- `503`: Email service temporarily unavailable

### Error Handling Features

1. **Business Email Priority**: If the business notification fails, the request fails
2. **Auto-reply Graceful Failure**: If auto-reply fails, the request still succeeds
3. **Specific Error Messages**: Users get appropriate feedback based on error type
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging

### Testing

The test file has been updated to work with older Node.js versions and provides a simple way to test the email functionality during development.

### Deployment Notes

- No additional npm packages required
- Works out-of-the-box with Vercel
- Environment variables must be configured in Vercel dashboard
- Follows Vercel serverless function best practices
